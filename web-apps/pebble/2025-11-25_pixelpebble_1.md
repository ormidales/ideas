# PixelPebble

## Concept

PixelPebble is a nostalgic yet forward-looking web-based design tool dedicated to recreating the distinctive, minimalist, and pixel-art aesthetic of the original Pebble smartwatches. Users can unleash their creativity by designing custom watch faces and digital displays using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. The platform offers a rich selection of retro-inspired fonts, pixel-art graphics, and essential data elements like time, date, and battery indicators. Beyond personal creation, PixelPebble allows users to export their designs as high-resolution images, animated GIFs, or even structured data formats, making them adaptable for modern e-ink projects, custom hardware displays, or as unique digital art. It caters to retro tech enthusiasts, designers seeking a minimalist canvas, and anyone who appreciates the enduring charm of Pebble's iconic visual language, bridging the gap between beloved past technology and future creative possibilities.

## Technical prompt

```md
Develop a modern web application named 'PixelPebble' using React, Vite (for fast development), and Tailwind CSS for styling. The application should be a watch face designer inspired by the Pebble smartwatch aesthetic, allowing users to create, customize, and export pixel-art style designs.Project Setup:1.  Initialize a new React project using Vite.2.  Configure Tailwind CSS following the official documentation for a Vite project.3.  Install necessary libraries: `lucide-react` for icons, `react-draggable` for drag-and-drop functionality, `html2canvas` for design export.Core Application Layout:The application should have a three-column layout:    Left Sidebar (Asset Panel): Fixed width (e.g., 250px). Contains draggable design elements and assets.    Central Canvas (Design Area): Fluid width, representing the watch face. This is where users drag and drop elements.    Right Sidebar (Properties Panel): Fixed width (e.g., 250px). Displays editable properties of the currently selected element.    Header: Contains application title, save/load/export buttons, and potentially a 'New Design' button.Key Components and Features:1.  Header Component:        `PixelPebble` title.        Buttons: `New Design`, `Save Design` (placeholder for future state persistence), `Load Design` (placeholder), `Export Design`.        Utilize `lucide-react` for icons (e.g., Plus, Save, Upload, Download, Share).2.  Canvas Component (`WatchCanvas.jsx`):        A central `div` acting as the watch face preview area (e.g., fixed aspect ratio like 144x168 for classic Pebble or user-definable aspect ratio, but start with 1:1 square for simplicity, e.g., 300x300px, with a subtle border to simulate a watch bezel).        Acts as a drop target for elements from the Asset Panel.        Displays all `CanvasElement` components.        Manages the state of all elements within the design (position, style, content, layer order).        On click, sets the active element to be edited in the Properties Panel.        Should handle drag-and-drop events for moving existing elements within the canvas.3.  Asset Panel Component (`AssetPanel.jsx`):        Sections for different asset types:            Time Elements: Digital time (HH:MM, HH:MM:SS), Analog clock components (hands, markers - initially focus on digital).            Date Elements: Day of week, Month, Day, Year.            System Elements: Battery percentage, Bluetooth status.            Text Elements: Customizable text string.            Shape Elements: Rectangle, Circle, Line (initially just rectangle for pixel art blocks).            Pixel Art Graphics: A selection of simple, retro-style pixel art icons (e.g., sun, cloud, heart, step icon). Provide a few SVG icons that can be stylized for pixel art feel.        Each asset should be a draggable item, creating a new `CanvasElement` instance when dropped onto the `WatchCanvas`.4.  Canvas Element Component (`CanvasElement.jsx`):        Represents an individual design element on the canvas.        Should be a `react-draggable` component, allowing users to move it around.        Displays the actual content (e.g., current time, static text, a shape).        When clicked, it should become the `activeElement` in the application state.        Should display a subtle border or handle when active.        Support for z-index/layering (e.g., a "bring to front" / "send to back" option in properties panel).5.  Properties Panel Component (`PropertiesPanel.jsx`):        Conditionally renders based on the `activeElement` state.        For the `activeElement`, display editable properties:            Position: X, Y coordinates (numeric inputs).            Size: Width, Height (numeric inputs for shapes/text bounds).            Text Content: Input field for text elements.            Font: Dropdown for pixel-art friendly fonts (e.g., 'Press Start 2P', 'Pixeloid Sans').            Font Size: Numeric input.            Color: Hex color picker (tailwind classes or simple input).            Background Color: For shapes.            Alignment: Left, Center, Right (for text).            Layering: Buttons for `Bring Forward` (`ArrowUp`), `Send Backward` (`ArrowDown`), `Bring to Front`, `Send to Back`.            `Delete Element` button (`Trash2`).State Management:    Use React Context API or Zustand for global state management.    Global State:        `designElements`: An array of objects, each representing a `CanvasElement` with properties like `id`, `type` (e.g., 'time', 'text', 'shape'), `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, `content`, `font`, `fontSize`, `color`, `backgroundColor`, `zIndex`.        `activeElementId`: The ID of the currently selected element.Export Functionality:    Export Design button in the Header.    When clicked, use `html2canvas` to capture the `WatchCanvas` component as an image (PNG).    Provide an option to download the generated image.    *Bonus:* Explore generating a GIF (e.g., for time updates) if `html2canvas` can be combined with other libraries or if a simpler approach is feasible initially (e.g., capturing multiple frames). Start with static PNG.Styling:    Exclusively use Tailwind CSS for all styling.    Focus on a clean, minimalist UI with a retro-tech color palette (e.g., muted grays, blacks, whites, and a single accent color).    Ensure the design is responsive, although the primary canvas might maintain a fixed aspect ratio.Development Workflow:1.  Set up React + Vite + Tailwind.2.  Implement the basic Header, Asset Panel, Canvas, and Properties Panel layout.3.  Develop the `CanvasElement` component to display static elements.4.  Implement drag-and-drop from Asset Panel to Canvas to create new `CanvasElement` instances.5.  Implement `react-draggable` for moving existing elements on the canvas.6.  Implement element selection and displaying properties in the `PropertiesPanel`.7.  Add property editing functionality (position, size, color, text content, font).8.  Integrate `html2canvas` for PNG export.Future Considerations (Mention but don't implement in initial build):    User authentication and cloud storage for designs.    Library of pre-made watch faces/templates.    More advanced element types (e.g., weather API integration).    GIF export for animated elements (e.g., blinking colon in time).    Export to JSON configuration for custom e-ink hardware projects.The AI should provide the full React component structure, state management logic, and Tailwind CSS classes for the described features, focusing on a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
