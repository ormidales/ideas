# Warlord's Chronicle

## Concept

Warlord's Chronicle is a dedicated web application for Warhammer players to elevate their narrative campaigns beyond simple record-keeping. It empowers players to meticulously track game outcomes, manage persistent army rosters with unit experience and injuries, oversee dynamic campaign maps with territory control, and most uniquely, automatically generate compelling narrative snippets and story prompts based on the unfolding events of their campaign. This tool transforms a series of battles into an epic saga, deepening player immersion, simplifying the administrative overhead of complex campaigns, and fostering a richer, more engaging storytelling experience for every Warhammer general.

## Technical prompt

Your task is to develop a single-page web application called 'Warlord's Chronicle' using React, Vite for bundling, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The application should be responsive and provide a seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices. Use `lucide-react` for icons and `recharts` for data visualization where specified. State management should be handled with `Zustand` for simplicity and efficiency. All data should be persisted using `localStorage` for now.Core Setup:1. Initialize a new React project using Vite.2. Configure Tailwind CSS.3. Set up `react-router-dom` for navigation (e.g., Dashboard, Campaigns, New Game, Army Roster).Global Components:*   Header: Fixed header with app name, navigation links (Dashboard, Campaigns, Armies), and possibly a simple theme toggle.*   Sidebar (Optional/Toggleable): For mobile, a toggleable drawer with navigation links.*   Footer: Basic copyright/info.*   Loading/Error States: Implement basic loading spinners and error message displays.Pages/Views:1. Dashboard Page (`/`)*   Displays an overview of currently active campaigns (e.g., "Campaign A - 3/5 Territories controlled," "Campaign B - Last Played: Yesterday").*   Quick links to "Start New Game" or "View All Campaigns."*   A small section showing "Recent Game Logs" (last 3-5 games played across all campaigns).*   Optional: A simple `recharts` graph showing overall win/loss ratio across all recorded games.2. Campaign List & Management Page (`/campaigns`)*   Campaign List:*   Displays all created campaigns in a card-based layout. Each card should show: Campaign Name, Edition, Number of Players, Last Played Date.*   Buttons on each card for "View Details," "Edit," "Delete."*   Create/Edit Campaign Form:*   Fields: Campaign Name (text), Warhammer Edition (dropdown: 40k, AoS, Horus Heresy, etc.), Campaign Type (e.g., Territory Control, Narrative Focus, Gauntlet), Number of Players (number input), Campaign Goal (text area, e.g., "Control all territories," "Defeat X enemy generals"), Initial Narrative Hook (text area).*   Ability to add/remove participating players (just names as text inputs for now).*   A simple visual representation of a campaign "map" if applicable (e.g., a grid of squares where each square is a territory that can be named and assigned to a player).3. Campaign Detail Page (`/campaigns/:id`)*   Campaign Overview Section: Displays basic campaign info (name, edition, players, goal, narrative hook).*   Campaign Map/Territory Tracker (if applicable):*   Interactive grid or list of territories. Each territory should display its name and current controller (player name).*   Ability to manually update territory control.*   Game Log List:*   Lists all games played within this specific campaign, ordered by date.*   Each entry: Date, Players Involved, Mission, Outcome (Win/Loss/Draw for current player), Link to "View Game Details."*   Button to "Log New Game."*   Campaign Progress Chart:*   Uses `recharts`. Example: A line chart showing territory control change over time, or a bar chart showing win/loss count per player.*   Narrative Chronicle Section:*   Displays automatically generated narrative snippets or user-added story entries.4. Log New Game Page (`/campaigns/:id/log-game`)*   Form Fields:*   Date of Game (date picker).*   Mission Name (text input).*   Players (dropdowns, selecting from participating players in the campaign).*   Factions for each player (text input).*   Army Lists (multi-line text area for each player's list).*   Victory Points (number input for each player).*   Game Outcome (dropdown: Player 1 Win, Player 2 Win, Draw).*   Brief Battle Summary (text area).*   Post-Game Effects Section:*   Ability to select a unit from either army and apply a "status effect" (e.g., "Injured," "Gained Experience," "Destroyed"). These effects should be tracked with the army roster.*   Ability to update territory control based on game outcome (dropdown for each relevant territory: Retained, Captured, Lost).*   Generate Narrative Prompt Button: (Initial version: Uses a simple template; future version: integrates with an LLM API).*   Upon clicking, it takes game outcome, mission, and battle summary to suggest a short narrative entry for the Campaign Detail Page. Example: "After a brutal skirmish over the 'Iron Ridge' objective, [Winning Player]'s [Faction] forces managed to seize control, inflicting heavy casualties on [Losing Player]'s [Faction], whose veteran unit, [Unit Name], suffered a crippling blow."5. Army Roster Page (`/armies`)*   Displays all unique units that have accumulated experience or injuries across all campaigns.*   Each unit card should show: Unit Name, Associated Player, Faction, Current Experience Level/Bonuses (e.g., "+1 Attack"), Current Injuries/Status Effects (e.g., "Wounded -1 Move").*   Ability to manually edit unit status.State Management (`Zustand`):*   Create stores for `campaigns`, `games`, `armies/units`.*   Ensure all data is loaded from `localStorage` on app initialization and saved to `localStorage` on any significant state change.Styling (`Tailwind CSS`):*   Consistent theme.*   Use utility classes for layout, typography, colors, and responsive design.*   Design for a clean, modern aesthetic suitable for a data management tool.Icons (`lucide-react`):*   Use relevant icons for navigation, actions (edit, delete, add), and status indicators.Testing (Optional but good to mention):*   (Not required for initial build, but consider future unit and integration tests).Deliverables:A fully functional React application demonstrating all specified features, styled with Tailwind CSS, using `localStorage` for persistence.
